Constants/ Variables of code:
ASCII_LOWERCASE = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
ASCII_UPPERCASE = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
DECIMAL_DIGITS = “0123456789”

In this assighnemnt I got a beter understading of python and it's versatilty  and from this assignment I created 8 different strings. These are:

* is_alpha- This string can return true if all the characters in the string are upper case or lower case (it returns false otherwise)
* is_digit - This string has one parameter. It returns if all of the characthers in the string are upper case or lower case
* to_lower - This string has one parameter. It returns the string which is a copy of the parameter, but where all of the upper case ASCII letters have been changed to lower ASCCII letters
 * to_upper - This string has one parameter. It returns the string which is a copy of
the parameter, but where all of the lower case ASCII letters have been converted to upper
case ASCII letters
* find_chr - This string has two parameters (both strings), where the second parameter
must be of length 1. It returns the lowest index where the second parameter is found
within the first parameter
* find_str - This string two parameters (both strings). It returns the lowest index where
the second parameter is found within the first parameter 
* repalce_str -  has three parameters (all strings). It returns the string which is
a copy of the first parameter, but where all occurrences of the second parameter have
been replaced by the third parameter. 
* replace_chr - has three parameters (all strings), where the second and third
parameters must be of length 1. It returns the string which is a copy of the first
parameter, but where all occurrences of the second parameter have been replaced by the
third parameter
